TEST PURPOSE: Blockchain Upload & Verification

This test ensures:
- A file can be uploaded to IPFS
- The resulting IPFS hash is valid
- The hash can be stored on the blockchain via smart contract
- The transaction is successfully mined and stored

This confirms blockchain interaction is functional and files are traceable.
