# TrustResearch

## Introduction
Academic integrity is fundamental to the credibility of research publications. However, fraudulent practices such as unverifiable claims, misleading citations, and citation padding have become increasingly prevalent. These issues undermine the trustworthiness of scientific literature and make the review process more challenging.

**TrustResearch** is a novel AI and blockchain-based system designed to enhance the credibility of research publications by detecting fraudulent behavior in submitted manuscripts. The system employs AI to validate research claims and uses blockchain technology for secure and immutable storage. Additionally, it utilizes graph-based citation analysis to assess the relevance of cited works, thereby identifying potentially misleading or unrelated references.

## What would be the “Demo” of the project?
The demo will illustrate how **TrustResearch** enhances research integrity by detecting fraudulent claims and verifying citations. It will involve the following key steps:

### 1. Manuscript Submission:
- A researcher submits a paper to the system for verification.
- The manuscript is stored securely on **IPFS**, with a hash recorded on the **Ethereum blockchain** for tamper-proof verification.

### 2. Automated Claim Validation (AI Component):
- The system extracts key claims from the manuscript and cross-references them with existing scientific databases.
- AI evaluates whether the claims are supported by prior research or flagged as unverifiable.

### 3. Graph-Based Citation Analysis:
- A graph-based citation network is constructed to assess the relevance of cited works.
- The system identifies instances of **citation padding** or **misleading references**.

### 4. Fraud Detection and Report Generation:
- The system generates an **integrity report** highlighting potential issues.
- Reviewers can access **AI-driven insights** to assist in their evaluation.

### 5. Blockchain-Based Transparency:
- Once a paper is verified, its metadata (**author details, verification results**) is stored securely on the blockchain, ensuring immutability.
- Reviewers and journal editors can retrieve verification records to maintain research credibility.

## Expected Outcome
- **For Researchers:** They receive feedback on their manuscript's credibility before submission.
- **For Reviewers:** The system simplifies fraud detection, reducing manual effort.
- **For Journals:** A transparent, blockchain-based system ensures research integrity.
- **For the Scientific Community:** Increased trust in published research.
